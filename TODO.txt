1. the model needs to be general enough, so that we can change options in the R code, without recompiling the cpp code. Things we might want to change include
- the time period over which the model is run. This is currently 1992-2013, but we should be able to add or remove years. - DONE
- the random effects. We should be able to turn this on/off as desired - DONE
- the ggplot/source issue to be resolved - DONE
- the surveys used. We currently use three surveys, 
  but it should be possible to easily include a new or remove a existing survey. 
  This is needed to check model sensitivity to surveys and also to 
  prepare for inclusion of new surveys from the Norwegian Sea - IN PROGRESS


2. New surveys and likelihood for age groups beyond the current 19+ group
As we discussed in Lauklines, Norwegian Sea surveys can be included as they provide recent information on the older fraction of the population. This means that we should be able to
- include new surveys (see above)
- calculate the likelihood for these new surveys based on older age groups (i.e. not stop at 19+)
- account for increase in age reading uncertainty eventually by grouping together different ages (e.g. 19-24, 25-29, 30-33, and so on)

3. Other things that are longer shots in time:
- incorporate estimates of uncertainties in catch@age and numbers@age from ECA/StoX
- prepare the TRACE document, i.e. full documentation of the model

- Change in demersal fleet selectivity-at-age in 2014
- Consider other models for the selectivity-at-age (random effects, other functional relationships)


- Creating reports from R (tabels etc)
- GitHub
- Graphs
- Retrospective patterns

4. Exercises and tests:
- set the observation error for the total catches as a free parameter (at least Alf).
- Use ecosystem survey for absolute scaling, and other suveys for proportions at age.

5. Weight-at-age
- Incorporate a growth model (e.g. Von Bertalanffy/Gompertz) for weiaght-at-age, with a general form (fixed effect) and variations from year to year (random effect).
- Add an observation model for the weight at age
- Add a likelihood component related to WAA.
-> This might be a solution to get rid of the 'noisy' signal from WAA data.
